# Javascript-dom-manipulation

Using the ufo dataset provided in the form of a JavaScript object, I've written code that appends a table to my web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
The input box with search button searches all the rows with the given date in the input box.
The input boxes on top of the columns are used for multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the criteria based on the table columns.
